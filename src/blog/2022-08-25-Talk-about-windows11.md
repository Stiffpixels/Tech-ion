description: Windows 11 was a surprise, after almost 6 years of windows 10. Windows 10 was true saviour after the disaster that was windows 8, so did the windows 11 meet the same expectations? Its hard to say in its early stages. Windows 11 surely looks better then windows 10 and has more customizations but less stable overall.
