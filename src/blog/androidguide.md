Most people if asked which phone they like to have would say iphone, and there are good reasons for that. Be it apples excellent customer service or how well built the phone is and the overall software features. However android cant be beaten when it comes to open source technology, customizations, development. 
When it comes to android it feels like its your very own phone as it allows you to do things iphone users can only think about, like install apps aside from appstore ;). Many developers prefer android as its very helpful with debugging their app by connecting their desktop to an android phone. It also runs a Linux kernel which is open source.
