      <p class="article-body">was a very easy going child but as I grew up, thinking about my career came naturally to me there were so many things I liked it was difficult to choose just one of them.</p>
      <p class="article-body"> I really liked everything beside what my country had to sell. I went in the direction on my way here music, illustration, graphic design, and played a whole <em>lot of games</em>.
